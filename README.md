# AI Bubble Stocks vs S&P 500
### Observing the performance of "AI Bubble" companies relative to the broader market

This project analyzes the performance of prominent AI-related companies (NVIDIA, Microsoft, Google, and Palantir) against the S&P 500 from November 2022 (start of the recent AI investment boom) to the present.  
The goal is to evaluate how these "AI bubble" stocks performed relative to the broader market, using Python, pandas, matplotlib, and yfinance.
